      <p>My name is Prashanti Pasupuleti. I am finding it hard to condense & tell about myself in just a single paragraph because I am a big personality.
           But on a serious note I am a person who values family the most in life. I am a people’s person and invariably always try to help people. 
            Its second nature to me - to always try new things; be it at work or in the kitchen. Quite honestly, I transitioned a little late in life towards IT and coding etc. however, I will be better at it soon in times to come. 
            I am learning coding as it is the only thing that will pay going forward in life; not just because people say it’s a sunrise industry.
            Programming skills are relevant even if you’re not programming. Things like SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript frameworks can be relevant to know for marketers, designers, salespeople, and 
            lots of other professions too. </p>
