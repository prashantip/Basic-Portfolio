      <p>Peacocks are a larger sized bird with a length from bill to tail of 100 to 115 cm (39 to 45 in) and to the end of a fully grown train as much as 195 to 225 cm (77 to 89 in) and weigh 4–6 kg (8.8–13.2 lb). 
          The females, or peahens, are smaller at around 95 cm (37 in) in length and weigh 2.75–4 kg (6.1–8.8 lb). 
          The green peafowl is slightly lighter in body mass despite the male having a longer train on average than the male of the Indian species. 
          Their size, colour and shape of crest make them unmistakable within their native distribution range. The male is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. 
          The fan-shaped crest on the head is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with bluish-green webbing.  
           </p>

       <p>The adult peahen has a rufous-brown head with a crest as in the male but the tips are chestnut edged with green. The upper body is brownish with pale mottling. The primaries, secondaries and tail 
           are dark brown. The lower neck is metallic green and the breast feathers are dark brown glossed with green. The remaining underparts are whitish.
            Downy young are pale buff with a dark brown mark on the nape that connects with the eyes.[8] Young males look like the females but the wings are chestnut coloured.</p>
